# Tailwind - For the win!

My career...

![Jags career](https://media.giphy.com/media/MS0fQBmGGMaRy/giphy.gif)

> You can argue which is the best JS libraries/frameworks/whatever but Tailwind is ðŸ’¯

## Write once, run everywhere

- Like jQuery Bootstrap played an import role in the days where browsers (IE) made web development difficult/impossible to get right

- Development became easier/faster using prebuilt components

- On boarding CSS didn't involve learning custom company css

- Foundation and other UI kits followed!

- It started appearing in job ads as a requirement!

- The solution to every problem is probably to add a div!

- All of this came at a cost!

## Have we met before?

- Sites started to look the same

- You had to start overriding things

- Specificity wars led to rise of !important

## Less/Scss/Whatever to the rescue

- Start providing your own variables

- Hard to control use of nesting/mixins

- Still one big css file at the end

- Could enforce styling rules, but not naming

- Had to run preprocessor

- 'Normally' these css files live in a galaxy far far away from the code

## Angular directives/React/Vue/Whatever changed the game

A component needs three things

- template
- css
- js

But if you're using a JS library/framework do you still need a UI Kit?

For React - [ReactStrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/)
For Vue - [vuetifyjs](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/)

- You can't use normal version of Bootstrap... why would you want to?

- You still have to learn their DSL

- Still have to turn into detective to find out what is going on

- You still have to override

- You now have them as a dependency!

- What happens if they don't fix a bug?

- What happens when they don't move to Bootstrap 5 or next version of Material Design?

- What happens if they stop supporting the version you're currently using?

- What happens when one of your dependencies clashes with theirs!

- Size is difficult to control

- What happens if you switch library/framework?

## So WTF is tailwind

- Utility CSS

- Bootstrap already starting to do this with [bootstrap utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/borders/)

- Design tokens!

- Design systems help provide constraints

- Performance

## The future of CSS

We want to be able to create components with just the CSS we need with some hope it works as we intended

- CSS in JS

- CSS modules

- Shadow dom!
